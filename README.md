# Zadoc

Zadoc is a free, open source program to connect via SSH (SSH via USB) to a jailbroken iPhone. It allows you to quickly connect to your phone by clicking a single button. The program will download the required components, run them with the appropriate arguments and the user's task will be to enter the login and password (if it has not been changed, the program itself will suggest the default used). The program is an experimental project, it is created for fun and to develop programming skills.

**First version will be uploaded before 2023 year!**
